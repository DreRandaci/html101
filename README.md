# HTML101
___

This was our first assigment, live coded, during the front end track at Nashville Software School. It outlines basic hardcode HTML structure for heading tags, tables, and label/input combinations, as well as simple CSS stylings. For exemplary purposes and practice. 

To run code, clone or fork repo. No dependencies required.
